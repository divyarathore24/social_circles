# social_circles
Social networking sites provide an option to manually categorize personal networks into Social Circles, which help users organize their personal social networks.  All major social networks provide such functionality, for example, ‘circles’ on Google+, and ‘lists’ on Facebook and Twitter. Each circle consists of a subset of a particular user's friends. Such circles may be disjoint, overlap, or be hierarchically nested. 
The motive of this project is to identify social circles automatically based on the network connections of the users and their friends. User’s friends create an overwhelming amount of data and to cope with the information users need to categorize friends into social circles. So far, this is being done manually. The purpose is to avoid the laborious task of constructing the circles and updating it whenever a user’s network grows. More precisely, for a given user and their personal social network, our goal is to identify social circles, which would be a subset of that user’s friend list.
The circles derived can overlap heavily or can be hierarchically nested in larger ones. Also these circle are not only densely connected but its members also share common properties or traits.
